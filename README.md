# Perceptron---The-simplest-neural-network
The Perceptron is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. It works as a linear classifier that computes a weighted sum of input features, adds a bias, and applies a threshold (step) activation function to produce the output.

The learning process involves updating the weights iteratively based on the prediction error, allowing the model to learn a decision boundary for linearly separable data. The perceptron is considered the simplest form of an artificial neuron and serves as the foundation for more complex neural network models.
